This guide walks you through the process of using Spring Integration to create a simple
application that retrieves data from an RSS Feed (Spring Blog), manipulates the data, and
then writes it to a file. This guide uses traditional Spring Integration XML
configuration. Other guides show how to use Java Configuration and DSL with and without
JDK 8 Lambda expressions.

== What You Will Build

You will create a flow with Spring Integration by using traditional XML configuration.

== Define an Integration Flow

For this guide's sample application, you will define a Spring Integration flow that:

* Reads blog posts from the RSS feed at spring.io.
* Transforms them into an easily readable `String` consisting of the post title and the URL for the post.
* Appends that `String` to the end of a file (`/tmp/si/SpringBlog`).

To define an integration flow, you can create a Spring XML configuration with a handful of
elements from Spring Integration's XML namespaces. Specifically, for the desired
integration flow, you work with elements from these Spring Integration namespaces: core,
feed, and file. (Getting the last two is why we had to modify the build files provided by
the Spring Initializr.)

The following XML configuration file (from
`src/main/resources/integration/integration.xml`) defines the integration flow.

Three integration elements are in play here:

* `<feed:inbound-channel-adapter>`: An inbound adapter that retrieves the posts, one per
poll. As configured here, it polls every five seconds. The posts are placed into a channel
named `news` (corresponding to the adapter's ID).
* `<int:transformer>`: Transforms entries (`com.rometools.rome.feed.synd.SyndEntry`) in
the `news` channel, extracting the entry's title (`payload.title`) and link
(`payload.link`) and concatenating them into a readable `String` (and adding a newline).
The `String` is then sent to the output channel named `file`.
* `<file:outbound-channel-adapter>`: An outbound channel adapter that writes content from
its channel (named `file`) to a file. Specifically, as configured here, it appends
anything in the `file` channel to a file at `/tmp/si/SpringBlog`.

The following image shows this simple flow:

Ignore the `auto-startup` attribute for now. We revisit that later when we discuss
testing. For now, notice that it is, by default, `true`, which means the posts are fetched
when the application starts. Also note the property placeholder in the
`filename-generator-expression`. It means that the default is `SpringBlog` but can be
overridden with a property.

== Make the Application Executable

Although it is common to configure a Spring Integration flow within a larger application
(perhaps even a web application), there is no reason that it cannot be defined in a
simpler standalone application. That is what you will do next: Create a main class that
kicks off the integration flow and that declares a handful of beans to support the
integration flow. You will also build the application into a standalone executable JAR
file. We use Spring Boot's `@SpringBootApplication` annotation to create the application
context. Since this guide uses the XML namespace for the integration flow, you must use
the `@ImportResource` annotation to load it into the application context. The following
listing (from `src/main/java/com/example/integration/IntegrationApplication.java`).

[[run]]
== Run the application

Now you can run the application from the jar by running the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
java -jar build/libs/{project_id}-0.1.0.jar

... app starts up ...
----
====

Once the application starts, it connects to the RSS feed and starts fetching blog posts.
The application processes those posts through the integration flow you defined, ultimately
appending the post information to a file at `/tmp/si/SpringBlog`.

After the application has been running for awhile, you should be able to view the file at
`/tmp/si/SpringBlog` to see the data from a handful of posts. On a UNIX-based operating
system, you can also `tail` the file to see the results, as they are written, by running
the following command:

====
[source,bash]
----
tail -f /tmp/si/SpringBlog
----
====

You should see something like the following sample output (though the actual news will
differ):

====
[source,bash]

== Testing

Examine the `complete` project and you will see a test case, in
`src/test/java/com/example/integration/FlowTests.java`.

This test uses Spring Boot's test support to set a property named `auto.startup` to
`false`. It is generally not a good idea to rely on a network connection for tests,
especially in a CI environment. Instead, we prevent the feed adapter from starting and
inject a `SyndEntry` into the `news` channel for processing by the rest of the flow. The
test also sets the `feed.file.name` so that the test writes to a different file. Then it:

- Verifies that the adapter is stopped.
- Creates a test `SyndEntry`.
- Deletes the test output file (if it is present).
- Sends the message.
- Verifies that the file exists.
- Reads the file and verifies that the data is as expected.

== Summary

Congratulations! You have developed a simple application that uses Spring Integration to
fetch blog posts from spring.io, process them, and write them to a file.
