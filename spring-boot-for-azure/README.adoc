This article walks you through deploying an application to Azure. 

IMPORTANT: You are recommended to check out https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/spring-framework/deploy-spring-boot-java-app-with-maven-plugin[offical Azure docs] for the latest instructions for the same task.

== What you'll build

You'll clone a sample Spring Boot application from GitHub and then use Maven to deploy it to Azure.

== What you'll need

The following prerequisites are required in order to follow the steps in this article:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can sign up for a https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/[free Azure account] or activate your https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/[MSDN subscriber benefits].
* An up-to-date http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/[Java Development Kit (JDK)], version 1.8 or later.
* A https://github.com/[Git] client.

== Build and run a sample Spring Boot web app locally

== Config and deploy the app to Azure

. From the terminal window, config your web app with https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/blob/develop/azure-webapp-maven-plugin/README.md/[Maven Plugin for Azure Web App] by typing `./mvnw com.microsoft.azure:azure-webapp-maven-plugin:1.8.0:config`. This mavne goal will first authenticate with Azure, if you have logged in with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/[Azure CLI], it will consume its existing authentication token. Otherwise, it will get you logged in with https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Maven-Plugin/[azure-maven-plugin] automatically.
. Then you can configure the deployment, run the maven command in the Command Prompt and use the default configurations by pressing *ENTER* until you get the *Confirm (Y/N)* prompt, press *'y'* and the configuration is done.

. Once you have configured all of the settings in the preceding sections of this article, you are ready to deploy your web app to Azure with `mvn azure-webapp:deploy`. Maven will deploy your web app to Azure; if the web app or web app plan does not already exist, it will be created for you. It might take a few minutes before the web app is accessible at the URL shown in the output. Navigate to the URL in a Web browser. You should see the message displayed: Greetings from Spring Boot!

== Summary

Congratulations! You built and deployed a Spring Boot app to Azure. You can visit the https://portal.azure.com/[Azure portal] to manage it. 

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to delete the Azure resources created if no longer needed.
