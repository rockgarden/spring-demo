/**
 * Building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a controller.
 * These components are identified by the @RestController annotation.
 * 
 * A key difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web
 * service controller shown earlier is the way that the HTTP response body is
 * created. Rather than relying on a view technology to perform server-side
 * rendering of the greeting data to HTML, this RESTful web service controller
 * populates and returns a Greeting object. The object data will be written
 * directly to the HTTP response as JSON.
 * 
 * This code uses Spring @RestController annotation, which marks the class as a
 * controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view. It
 * is shorthand for including both @Controller and @ResponseBody.
 * 
 * The Greeting object must be converted to JSON. Thanks to Spring’s HTTP
 * message converter support, you need not do this conversion manually. Because
 * Jackson 2 is on the classpath, Spring’s MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter
 * is automatically chosen to convert the Greeting instance to JSON.

	 * Implementation of the method body creates and returns a new Greeting object
	 * with id and content attributes based on the next value from the counter and
	 * formats the given name by using the greeting template.

	 * @param name
