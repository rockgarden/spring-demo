= CORS support in Spring Framework

For security reasons, browsers prohibit AJAX calls to resources residing outside the current origin. For example, as you’re checking your bank account in one tab, you could have the evil.com website in another tab. The scripts from evil.com shouldn’t be able to make AJAX requests to your bank API (withdrawing money from your account!) using your credentials.

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a W3C specification implemented by most browsers that allows you to specify in a flexible way what kind of cross domain requests are authorized, instead of using some less secured and less powerful hacks like IFrame or JSONP.

Spring Framework 4.2 GA provides first class support for CORS out-of-the-box, giving you an easier and more powerful way to configure it than typical filter based solutions.

Spring MVC provides high-level configuration facilities, described bellow.

== Controller method CORS configuration

You can add to your @RequestMapping annotated handler method a @CrossOrigin annotation in order to enable CORS on it (by default @CrossOrigin allows all origins and the HTTP methods specified in the @RequestMapping annotation):

====
[source,java]
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/account")
public class AccountController {

	@CrossOrigin
	@GetMapping("/{id}")
	public Account retrieve(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}

	@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
	public void remove(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}
}
----
====

It is also possible to enable CORS for the whole controller:

====
[source,java]
----
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://domain2.com", maxAge = 3600)
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/account")
public class AccountController {

	@GetMapping("/{id}")
	public Account retrieve(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}

	@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
	public void remove(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}
}
----
====

In this example CORS support is enabled for both retrieve() and remove() handler methods, and you can also see how you can customize the CORS configuration using @CrossOrigin attributes.

You can even use both controller and method level CORS configurations, Spring will then combine both annotation attributes to create a merged CORS configuration.

====
[source,java]
----
@CrossOrigin(maxAge = 3600)
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/account")
public class AccountController {

	@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://domain2.com")
	@GetMapping("/{id}")
	public Account retrieve(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}

	@DeleteMapping("/{id}")
	public void remove(@PathVariable Long id) {
		// ...
	}
}
----
====

If you are using Spring Security, make sure to link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/[enable CORS at Spring Security level] as well to allow it to leverage the configuration defined at Spring MVC level. 在Spring Security级别启用CORS]，以允许它利用在Spring MVC级别定义的配置。

====
[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		http.cors().and()...
	}
}
----
====


== Global CORS configuration

In addition to fine-grained, annotation-based configuration you’ll probably want to define some global CORS configuration as well. This is similar to using filters but can be declared withing Spring MVC and combined with fine-grained `@CrossOrigin` configuration. By default all origins and `GET`, `HEAD` and `POST` methods are allowed.

=== JavaConfig

Enabling CORS for the whole application is as simple as:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc
public class WebConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {

	@Override
	public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
		registry.addMapping("/**");
	}
}
----
====

If you are using Spring Boot, it is recommended to just declare a `WebMvcConfigurer bean` as following:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
        return new WebMvcConfigurerAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
                registry.addMapping("/**");
            }
        };
    }
}
----
====

You can easily change any properties, as well as only apply this CORS configuration to a specific path pattern:

====
[source,java]
----
@Override
public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
	registry.addMapping("/api/**")
		.allowedOrigins("http://domain2.com")
		.allowedMethods("PUT", "DELETE")
			.allowedHeaders("header1", "header2", "header3")
		.exposedHeaders("header1", "header2")
		.allowCredentials(false).maxAge(3600);
}
----
====

If you are using Spring Security, make sure to link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/[enable CORS at Spring Security level] as well to allow it to leverage the configuration defined at Spring MVC level.

== XML namespace

It is also possible to configure CORS with the mvc XML namespace.

This minimal XML configuration enable CORS on `/**` path pattern with the same default properties than the JavaConfig one:

====
[source,xml]
----
<mvc:cors>
	<mvc:mapping path="/**" />
</mvc:cors>
----
====

It is also possible to declare several CORS mappings with customized properties:

====
[source,xml]
----
<mvc:cors>

	<mvc:mapping path="/api/**"
		allowed-origins="http://domain1.com, http://domain2.com"
		allowed-methods="GET, PUT"
		allowed-headers="header1, header2, header3"
		exposed-headers="header1, header2" allow-credentials="false"
		max-age="123" />

	<mvc:mapping path="/resources/**"
		allowed-origins="http://domain1.com" />

</mvc:cors>
----
====

If you are using Spring Security, don’t forget to enable CORS at Spring Security level as well:

====
[source,xml]
----
<http>
	<!-- Default to Spring MVC's CORS configuration -->
	<cors />
	...
</http>
----
====

== How does it work?

CORS requests link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-webmvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/servlet/FrameworkServlet.java#L906[including preflight ones with an OPTIONS method] are automatically dispatched to the various HandlerMappings registered. They handle CORS preflight requests and intercept CORS simple and actual requests thanks to a link:https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/CorsProcessor.html[CorsProcessor] implementation (link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/cors/DefaultCorsProcessor.java[DefaultCorsProcessor] by default) in order to add the relevant CORS response headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`). link:https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.2.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/CorsConfiguration.html[CorsConfiguration] allows you to specify how the CORS requests should be processed: allowed origins, headers, methods, etc. It can be provided in various ways:

* AbstractHandlerMapping#setCorsConfiguration() allows to specify a Map with several CorsConfiguration mapped on path patterns like /api/**
* Subclasses can provide their own CorsConfiguration by overriding AbstractHandlerMapping#getCorsConfiguration(Object, HttpServletRequest) method
* Handlers can implement CorsConfigurationSource interface (like ResourceHttpRequestHandler now does) in order to provide a CorsConfiguration for each request.

== Filter based CORS support

As an alternative to other methods presented above, Spring Framework also provides a CorsFilter. In that case, instead of using @CrossOrigin or WebMvcConfigurer#addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry), you can for example declare the filter as following in your Spring Boot application:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public FilterRegistrationBean corsFilter() {
		UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();
		CorsConfiguration config = new CorsConfiguration();
		config.setAllowCredentials(true);
		config.addAllowedOrigin("http://domain1.com");
		config.addAllowedHeader("*");
		config.addAllowedMethod("*");
		source.registerCorsConfiguration("/**", config);
		FilterRegistrationBean bean = new FilterRegistrationBean(new CorsFilter(source));
		bean.setOrder(0);
		return bean;
	}
}

= Enabling Cross Origin Requests for a RESTful Web Service

This guide walks you through the process of creating a "`Hello, World`" RESTful web service with Spring that includes headers for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the response. You can find more information about Spring CORS support in this
link:/blog/2015/06/08/cors-support-in-spring-framework[blog post].

== What You Will Build

You will build a service that accepts HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/greeting` and responds with a JSON representation of a greeting, as
the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
====

You can customize the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string, as
the following listing shows:

====
[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
----
====

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of `World` and is reflected in the
response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, User!"}
----
====

This service differs slightly from the one described in
{gs-rest-service}[Building a RESTful Web Service], in that it uses Spring Framework CORS
support to add the relevant CORS response headers.

=== Adding the `httpclient` Dependency

The tests (in
`complete/src/test/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingIntegrationTests.java`)
require the Apache `httpclient` library.

To add the Apache `httpclient` library to Maven, add the following dependency:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
====

The following listing shows the finished `pom.xml` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/pom.xml[]
----
====

To add the Apache `httpclient` library to Gradle, add the following dependency:

====
[source,text]
----
testImplementation 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient'
----
====


== Create a Resource Representation Class

Now that you have set up the project and build system, you can create your web service.

Begin the process by thinking about service interactions.

The service will handle `GET` requests to `/greeting`, optionally with a `name` parameter
in the query string. The `GET` request should return a `200 OK` response with JSON in the
body to represent a greeting. It should resemble the following listing:

====
[source,json]
----
{
    "id": 1,
    "content": "Hello, World!"
}
----
====

The `id` field is a unique identifier for the greeting, and `content` is the textual
representation of the greeting.

To model the greeting representation, create a resource representation class. Provide a
plain old Java object with fields, constructors, and accessors for the `id` and `content`
data, as the following listing (from
  `src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/Greeting.java`) .

NOTE: Spring uses the {jackson}[Jackson JSON] library to automatically marshal instances
of type `Greeting` into JSON.

== Create a Resource Controller

In Spring's approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. These components are easily identified by the {Controller}[`@Controller`] annotation, and the `GreetingController` shown in the following listing (from `src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) handles `GET` requests for `/greeting` by returning a new instance of the `Greeting` class.

This controller is concise and simple, but there is plenty going on under the hood. We break it down step by step.

The `@RequestMapping` annotation ensures that HTTP requests to `/greeting` are mapped to the `greeting()` method.

NOTE: The preceding example uses the `@GetMapping` annotation, which acts as a shortcut
for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`.

`@RequestParam` binds the value of the `name` query string parameter into the `name`
parameter of the `greeting()` method. This query string parameter is not `required`. If it
is absent in the request, the `defaultValue` of `World` is used.

The implementation of the method body creates and returns a new `Greeting` object, with
the value of the `id` attribute based on the next value from the `counter` and the value
of the `content` based on the query parameter or the default value. It also formats the
given `name` by using the greeting `template`.

A key difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web service
controller shown earlier is the way that the HTTP response body is created. Rather than
relying on a view technology to perform server-side rendering of the greeting data to
HTML, this RESTful web service controller populates and returns a `Greeting` object. The
object data is written directly to the HTTP response as JSON.

To accomplish this, the {ResponseBody}[`@ResponseBody`] annotation on the `greeting()`
method tells Spring MVC that it does not need to render the greeting object through a
server-side view layer. Instead, the returned greeting object is the response body and
should be written out directly.

The `Greeting` object must be converted to JSON. Thanks to Spring's HTTP message converter
support, you need not do this conversion manually. Because {jackson}[Jackson] is on the
classpath, Spring's
{MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter}[`MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`] is
automatically chosen to convert the `Greeting` instance to JSON.

== Enabling CORS

You can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) from either in individual controllers or
globally. The following topics describe how to do so:

* <<controller-method-cors-configuration>>
* <<global-cors-configuration>>

[[controller-method-cors-configuration]]
=== Controller Method CORS Configuration

So that the RESTful web service will include CORS access control headers in its response,
you have to add a `@CrossOrigin` annotation to the handler method, as the following
listing (from `src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
	@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:9000")
	@GetMapping("/greeting")
	public Greeting greeting(@RequestParam(required=false, defaultValue="World") String name) {
		System.out.println("==== in greeting ====");
		return new Greeting(counter.incrementAndGet(), String.format(template, name));
	}
----
====

This `@CrossOrigin` annotation enables cross-origin resource sharing only for this
specific method. By default, its allows all origins, all headers, and the HTTP methods
specified in the `@RequestMapping` annotation. Also, a `maxAge` of 30 minutes is used. You
can customize this behavior by specifying the value of one of the following annotation
attributes:

* `origins`
* `methods`
* `allowedHeaders`
* `exposedHeaders`
* `allowCredentials`
* `maxAge`.

In this example, we allow only `http://localhost:9000` to send cross-origin requests.

NOTE: You can also add the `@CrossOrigin` annotation at the controller class level as
well, to enable  CORS on all handler methods of this class.

[[global-cors-configuration]]
=== Global CORS configuration

In addition (or as an alternative) to fine-grained annotation-based configuration, you can
define some global CORS configuration as well. This is similar to using a `Filter` but can
be declared within Spring MVC and combined with fine-grained `@CrossOrigin` configuration.
By default, all origins and `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` methods are allowed.

The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) shows the
`greetingWithJavaconfig` method in the `GreetingController` class:

====
[source,java]
----
	@GetMapping("/greeting-javaconfig")
	public Greeting greetingWithJavaconfig(@RequestParam(required=false, defaultValue="World") String name) {
		System.out.println("==== in greeting ====");
		return new Greeting(counter.incrementAndGet(), String.format(template, name));
	}
----
====

NOTE: The difference between the `greetingWithJavaconfig` method and the `greeting` method
(used in the <<controller-method-cors-configuration,controller-level CORS configuration>>)
is the route (`/greeting-javaconfig` rather than `/greeting`) and the presence of the
`@CrossOrigin` origin.

The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`) shows how to
add CORS mapping in the application class:

====
[source,java]
----
	public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
		return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
			@Override
			public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
				registry.addMapping("/greeting-javaconfig").allowedOrigins("http://localhost:9000");
			}
		};
	}
----
====

You can easily change any properties (such as `allowedOrigins` in the example), as well as
apply this CORS configuration to a specific path pattern.

TIP: You can combine global- and controller-level CORS configuration.

== Creating the Application Class

The Spring Initializr creates a bare-bones application class for you. The following
listing (from
`initial/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`) .
====

You need to add a method to configure how to handle cross-origin resource sharing. The
following listing (from
`complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`)
shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
	@Bean
	public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
		return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
			@Override
			public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
				registry.addMapping("/greeting-javaconfig").allowedOrigins("http://localhost:9000");
			}
		};
	}
----
====

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.

== Test the service

Now that the service is up, visit `http://localhost:8080/greeting`, where you should see:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
====

Provide a `name` query string parameter by visiting
`http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User`. The value of the `content` attribute changes
from `Hello, World!` to `Hello User!`, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":2,"content":"Hello, User!"}
----
====

This change demonstrates that the `@RequestParam` arrangement in `GreetingController`
works as expected. The `name` parameter has been given a default value of `World` but can
always be explicitly overridden through the query string.

Also, the `id` attribute has changed from `1` to `2`. This proves that you are working
against the same `GreetingController` instance across multiple requests and that its
`counter` field is being incremented on each call, as expected.

Now you can test that the CORS headers are in place and allow a Javascript client from
another origin to access the service. To do so, you need to create a Javascript client to
consume the service. The following listing shows such a client:


First, create a simple Javascript file named `hello.js` (from `complete/public/hello.js`).

This script uses jQuery to consume the REST service at `http://localhost:8080/greeting`.
It is loaded by `index.html`.

Because the REST service is already running on localhost at port 8080, you need to be sure
to start the client from another server or port. Doing so not only avoids a collision
between the two applications but also ensures that the client code is served from a
different origin than the service. To start the client running on localhost at port 9000,
run the following Maven command:

====
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=9000
# 参数无效没有运行在9000端口上
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/rest-service-cors-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=9000
----
====


Once the client starts, open http://localhost:9000 in your browser, where you should see
the following:

image::images/hello.png[Model data retrieved from the REST service is rendered into the DOM if the proper CORS headers are in the response.]

If the service response includes the CORS headers, then the ID and content are rendered
into the page. But if the CORS headers are missing (or insufficiently defined for the
client), the browser fails the request and the values are not rendered into the DOM. 

如果服务响应包含CORS标头，则ID和内容将呈现到页面中。 但是，如果缺少CORS标头（或未为客户端充分定义），则浏览器将使请求失败，并且不会将值呈现到DOM中。

In that case, you should see the following:

image::images/hello_fail.png[The browser will fail the request if the CORS headers are missing from the response. No data will be rendered into the DOM.]


== Summary

Congratulations! You have just developed a RESTful web service that includes Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing with Spring.
